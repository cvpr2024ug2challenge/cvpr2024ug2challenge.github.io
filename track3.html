              <p>Images captured in adverse weather conditions significantly impact the performance of many vision tasks. Rain is a common weather phenomenon that introduces visual degradations to captured images and videos through partial occlusions of objects â€“ in heavy rain, severe occlusion to the background. As most vision algorithms assume clear weather, with no interference of rain, their performance suffers. Deraining is the task of removing such visual degradations so that the images are better suited to the assumptions of downstream vision algorithms, as well as for aesthetic fruition. </p>

              <p>UG<sup>2</sup>+ Track 3 aims to promote the development of novel single image deraining algorithms for real images. The competition will feature diverse and challenging scenarios that include (i) various types of rain conditions (i.e. long and short streaks, various densities and accumulation, with and without rain fog), (ii) large variety of background scenes from urban locations (i.e. buildings, streets, cityscapes) to natural scenery (i.e. forests, plains, hills), (iii) varying degrees of illumination from different times of day, and all of which are captured by (iv) cameras that cover a wide array of resolutions, noise levels, and intrinsic parameters. In a collaboration with the authors of GT-RAIN, we will introduce an additional 15 extra scenes set aside as a benchmark test set. The challenge will be split into three phases (training, validation, and testing), where data corresponding to each phase will be released to the participants. The validation set will consist of 5400 frames covering 18 scenes and the testing set 4500 frames covering 15 scenes. Unlike previous evaluation protocols that were limited to qualitative evaluation on real images, the submissions will be evaluated quantitatively using standard metrics like PSNR and SSIM. The ranking of algorithms will be determined based on evaluation scores on the testing set. The first place winner will be awarded $1000 USD, second place will be awarded $800 USD, and third place $500 USD. </p>

              <p>The WeatherProof Challenge invites the public to innovate solutions for the challenging task of semantic segmentation on images degraded by various degrees of weather from all around the world. The competition builds off of our previous dataset <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d-OROwnLuibl0cTAfl2zXlpG97DeGBue">WeatherStream</a> [1] comprised of weathered and deweathered images from over 174k pictures. With the new dataset <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d-OROwnLuibl0cTAfl2zXlpG97DeGBue">WeatherProof</a> [2], we now provide a dataset of both weathered and deweathered images that have semantic segmentation labels.</p>

              <p>Semantic segmentation has rich history in countless applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and scene understanding. The current pace of advancements has been accelerated by the introduction of large, generally-pretrained, foundational models. In fact, these foundational models consistently dominate the leaderboards of competitive semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e. ADE20K, Cityscapes, by placing in the top 5 rankings. Yet, despite their success on these leaderboards, when presented with images with visual degradations, i.e., those captured under adverse conditions, their performance similarly degrades.</p>

              <p>Existing work has provided datasets and methods with this goal of studying the effects of these natural phenomenons. However, as it is difficult to capture paired datasets to study them in a controlled setting, existing datasets have resorted to the use of synthetic weather effects, or include misalignments in the underlying scene between degraded and clear-weather images. To address this, we build off of the WeatherStream dataset to introduce the WeatherProof Dataset, the first semantic segmentation dataset with accurately paired clear and weather-degraded image pairs.</p>

              <p>The aim of this competition is to study the weather phenomenon in real world scenarios and to spark novel ideas that will further enhance the development of semantic segmentation methods on weathered real images. As part of the competition, each team must register on the competition website and must use the WeatherProof Dataset to train their models. Teams can also (if they choose) use the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d-OROwnLuibl0cTAfl2zXlpG97DeGBue">WeatherStream Dataset</a> which is still paired and larger, but does not include semantic segmentation label for self-supervised and unsupervised training methods. Teams must submit an arXiv Paper which includes author(s) name and affiliation, method (and a method title), datasets used, and source of data (real, pseudo-real, synthetic), and hardware and email the link to <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: underline" href="mailto:WeatherProofChallenge@gmail.com">WeatherProofChallenge@gmail.com</a> to be considered. Teams are open to use additional datasets to push performance, but must include details of them in the arXiv paper.</p>

              <p>The competition will be held in phases where the training, validation (dry-run) and testing sets will be released.</p>
